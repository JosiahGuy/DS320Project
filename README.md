# DS320Project

Looking at College Football Scores!

This is the Term Project for DS 320 at PSU. Josiah Guy, Katelinh Jones, and Nathan Tack are the team members.

# Background

In the 2018 College Football season, sports-statistics.com collected data on the receiving, defense, and rushing statistics. These statistics provide insight into individual players and teams in the 2018 season.

# Data

# Approach

We will be integrating the receiving, defense, and rushing statistics into one dataset.

# Method

Will be integrating the three sources together using pandas in a Jupyter Notebook. From there will be using an xgboost classifier to predict number of touchdowns in the 2018 Big 10 Football Season based on the integrated data, and strongest features.

# Results

Opportunities for further analysis include integrating more data with more players and teams.
