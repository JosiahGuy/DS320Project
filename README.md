# Objective

The goal of our project was to use receiving, rushing, and passing statistics from across the 2018 NCAA college football season in order to predict the number of touchdowns each team scored. Through data integration steps, we were able to combine 30 datasets and aggregate Linear Regression and XGBoost models in order to achieve results to satisfy our research question.
